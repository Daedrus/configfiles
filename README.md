# configfiles

A repo containing my configuration files.

I used to use ansible and vagrant to quickly set up VMs where I could test
stuff. I've since then started using NixOS so this repository will most
likely contain scripts and configuration files for that.

For the ansible and vagrant stuff, check out older commits of this repository.
The last commit using them is tagged as vagrant\_and\_ansible.
