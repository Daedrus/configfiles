# configfiles

A repo containing my configuration files (dotfiles).

I used to use ansible and vagrant to quickly set up VMs where I could test
stuff. I've since then started using NixOS so this repository contains
scripts and configuration files for that (you can see them in `nix/`).

You will often find `embci` mentioned in the nix files since I am currently
using NixOS when working on my [embci](https://github.com/Daedrus/embci) project.

For the ansible and vagrant stuff, check out older commits of this repository.
The last commit using them is tagged as `vagrant_and_ansible`.
